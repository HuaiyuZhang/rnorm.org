---

The 2018 Rnorm: R and Applied Statistics Symposium will be held in February 25, 2018 at Business Building of Kansas State University. The theme of this conference is R and Statistics for new generation. In recognition of the advent of a new generation of R researchers, we hope to attract young researchers, practitioners from academia, government and industry as well as current students from all subjects. This is a forum of discussion for development of R skillsets, reproducible research, R applications in statistics and data science, offering both short courses and presentations by interest group. Young professions may be able to learn from and interact with senior professions.
